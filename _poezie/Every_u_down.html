Every U down in Uville liked U.S. a lot,<br>
But the Binch, who lived Far East of Uville, did not. <p>

The Binch hated U.S.! the whole U.S. way!<br>
Now don't ask me why, for nobody can say, <p>

It could be his turban was screwed on too tight<br>
Or the sun from the desert had beaten too bright <p>

But I think that the most likely reason of all<br>
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small. <p>

But, Whatever the reason, his heart or his turban,<br>
He stood facing Uville, the part that was urban. <p>

"They're doing their business," he snarled from his perch.<br>
"They're raising their families! They're going to church<p>

!" They're leading the world, and their empire is thriving,<br>
I MUST keep the S's and U's from surviving! <p>

Tomorrow, he knew, all the U's and the S's<br>
Would put on their pants and their shirts and their dresses, <p>

They'd go to their offices, playgrounds and schools,<br>
And abide by their U and S values and rules, <p>

And then they'd do something he liked least of all,<br>
Every U down in U-ville, the tall and the small, <p>

Would stand all united, each U and each S,<br>
And they'd sing Uville's anthem, "God bless us! God bless!" <p>

All around their Twin Towers of Uville, they'd stand,<br>
and their voices would drown every sound in the land. <p>

"I must stop that singing," Binch said with a smirk,<br>
And he had an indea - and idea that might work! <p>

The Binch stole some U planes in U morning hours,<br>
And crashed them right into the Uville Twin Towers. <p>

"They'll wake to disaster!" he snickered, so sour,<br>
"And how can they sing when they can't find a tower?" <p>

The Binch cocked his ear as they woke from their sleeping,<br>
All set to enjoy their U-wailing and weeping, <p>

Instead he heard something that started quite low,<br>
And it built up quite slow, but it started to grow - <p>

And the Binch heard the most unpredictable thing....<br>
And he couldn't believe it - they started to sing! <p>

He stared down at U-ville, not trusting his eyes,<br>
What he saw was a shockinf, disgusting suprise! <p>

Every U down in U-ville, the tall and the small,<br>
Was singing! Withou any towers at all! <p>

He HADN'T stopped U-ville from singing! it sung!<br>
For down deep in hearts of the old and the young, <p>

Those Twin Towers were standing, called Hope and called Pride,<br>
And you can't smash the towers we hold deep inside. <p>

So we circle the sites where our heroes did fall,<br>
With a hand in each hand of the tall and the small, <p>

And we mourn for our losses while knowing we'll cope,<br>
For we still have inside that U-pride and U-Hope. <p>

For America means a bit more than tall towers,<br>
It means more than wealth or political powers, <p>

It's more than our enemies ever sould guess,<br>
So may God bless America! Bless us! God bless...<p>
